## Regex Components
A regular expression (also called regex or regexp) is a way to describe a pattern. It is used to locate or validate specific strings or patterns of text in a sentence, document, or any other character input.

Regular expressions use both basic and special characters. Basic characters are standard letters, numbers, and general keyboard characters, while all other characters are considered special.

This article will introduce special characters and discuss using them in regex and extended regular expressions (ERE) with plenty of examples.
